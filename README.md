# Installation

Python>=3.8.0 environment, including PyTorch>=1.8.
The command is as follows.

```bash
conda create -n aaai python=3.8
conda activate aaai
pip install -r requirements.txt  # install
```
# Datasets

Please prepare the data in the YOLO dataset format. We will provide the preprocessed data, including images and labels, which can be directly used for training. Additionally, we will also provide the trained weights, which can be directly used for testing.

# Training
Most of training configurations can change in the "Train settings" section of ultralytics/cfg/default.yaml. 
The key factors are model, data, img, epoches, batch, device and training hyperparameters.
For example, you can use "modelï¼šYOLO-improved.yaml" to train an object detection model.

```bash
python train.py 
```

# Evaluation
Most of evaluation configurations can change in the "Val/Test settings" section of ultralytics/cfg/default.yaml. 
The key factors are model(weight), data, img, batch, conf, iou, half.

```bash
python ultralytics/models/yolo/detect/val.py
```
